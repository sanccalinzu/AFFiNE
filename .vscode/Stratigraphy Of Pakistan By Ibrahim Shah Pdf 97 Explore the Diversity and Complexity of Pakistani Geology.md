# Review of Stratigraphy of Pakistan by S. M. Ibrahim Shah
 
Stratigraphy of Pakistan is a comprehensive book that covers the geological history and evolution of Pakistan from the Precambrian to the Quaternary. The book is written by S. M. Ibrahim Shah, a renowned geologist and former director general of the Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP). The book was published in 2009 by the GSP as volume 22 of its Memoirs series.
 
The book consists of 381 pages and is divided into 12 chapters. The first chapter provides an introduction and overview of the geology and tectonics of Pakistan, as well as the stratigraphic nomenclature and classification used in the book. The second chapter deals with the Precambrian rocks of Pakistan, which include the oldest known rocks in the country, such as the Archean gneisses and granites of the Indian Shield. The third chapter describes the Paleozoic rocks of Pakistan, which record the formation and breakup of Gondwana, as well as the development of various sedimentary basins and orogenic belts. The fourth chapter covers the Mesozoic rocks of Pakistan, which are mainly represented by marine and continental deposits of the Indo-Pakistani Plate. The fifth chapter discusses the Cenozoic rocks of Pakistan, which are dominated by the Himalayan orogeny and its associated foreland basins, as well as the volcanic and magmatic activity in different regions. The sixth chapter focuses on the Quaternary deposits of Pakistan, which include glacial, fluvial, lacustrine, aeolian, coastal, and karstic sediments. The seventh chapter reviews the fossil record of Pakistan, which spans from the Cambrian to the Pleistocene and includes various groups of plants, animals, and microorganisms. The eighth chapter summarizes the economic geology of Pakistan, which encompasses a wide range of mineral resources, such as coal, oil, gas, metallic ores, gemstones, industrial minerals, and building materials. The ninth chapter outlines the environmental geology of Pakistan, which deals with issues such as natural hazards, groundwater resources, soil erosion, land degradation, pollution, and climate change. The tenth chapter presents some case studies of stratigraphic correlation and mapping in different areas of Pakistan, using various methods and techniques. The eleventh chapter provides a bibliography of references cited in the book, as well as some additional sources for further reading. The twelfth chapter contains several appendices that contain useful data and information on various aspects of stratigraphy.
